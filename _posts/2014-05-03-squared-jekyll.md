Jekyll is pretty rad and figured releasing a cleaned up version of my site as a theme for others to hack and build on would be fun. So here be that theme â€” I call it Block-log, a responsive Jekyll theme focused on minimalism for personal blogs.

[Live Demo](http://anandu.info/block-log)

[Download](https://github.com/anandubajith/block-log/archive/master.zip)

[Github Repo](https://github.com/anandubajith/block-log)


Setting up
====================
To start you own blog, simply git clone the repository on github. You could also press the "fork" button on github.
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/anandubajith/block-log.git</code></pre>
Then you will need to edit the _config.yml file at the root of repository.

To add your own posts, add a file to the _posts directory which has the name year-month-day-title.md. 
<br>Note - the file does not have to be markdown.

To publish the post, just <code>git push</code> it to your own github repo and your set!

Things to change on `_config.yml`
====================
There is a config file at the root called `_config.yml`. By Default it looks like:

    name: block-log
    description: Hi, This is <b>block-log</b>.<br>A Jekyll theme build with minimalist blocks
    markdown: redcarpet
    pygments: true
    disqus-id: anandu
    email: me@example.com
    twitter: twitterusername
    github: gitusername
    
You will need to change <code>name</code> , <code>url</code> , <code>twitter-username</code> and <code>github</code>. All others are optional, Here is what the variables mean.<br>

<code>name</code> - The name of your jekyll site.<br>
<code>description</code> - A description for your site<br>
<code>markdown</code> - The preferred markdown to use. <br>
<code>disqus-id</code> - the disqus id, if not set comments will not be shown.<br>
<code>twitter-username</code> - Your Twitter username , used while sharing.<br>
<code>email</code> - your email,if unset willnot be shown<br>
<code>github</code> - Your github username<br><br>
